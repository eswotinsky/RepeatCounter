## Specifications

1. App routes users to the home page, which displays a form with two fields for entering text and a submit button.

    1. Example Input: "dog", "She took her dog for a walk, and they visited the dog park".
    2. Example Output: Your word appears 2 times.

3. If one or both fields contains no data when the form is submitted, nothing is displayed.
