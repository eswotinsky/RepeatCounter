Program should check a single-character word against a string of words, returning the number of times that the single-character word appears in the string.
    Example input: "I", "I am the walrus"
    Example output: 1


Program should check a multiple-character word against a string of words, returning the number of times the multiple-character word appears in the string of words.
    Example input: "the", "I am the walrus"
    Example output: 1


Program should ignore capitalization for purposes of finding matches between inputted word and inputted sentence.
    Example input: "ThE", "I am the walrus"
    Example output: 1


Program should only count full-word matches, not partial ones (i.e. ignoring when the first string passed in is contained within a word in the second string).
